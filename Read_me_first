all of the projects that I have created for the porpuse of practice placed inside of DOCS file.

in order to view those projects use the link below:

https://a331998513.github.io/practice/ (FOLDER NAME) /index.html

Example: 
https://a331998513.github.io/practice/quote_machine/index.html

PS: you dont need to include /docs/ in the url, I don't know why either.
