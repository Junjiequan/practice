## I'm probably gonna redo all the Free code camp projects again with pure javascript and put link below here soon.

>coming soon. Nah, actually I created new folder to redo

## The very first personal project I have chosen:      [Tetris(JS)](https://a331998513.github.io/practice/Tetris/) with pure javascript

# main goal

practice DOM, JS syntax and most importantly train my brain adapt to the language logic.

# sources used help building
stackOverflow, Google, Youtube, w3shools, *[original tutorial link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1JJfK09ujQ&t=4610s)*.

## what have I done differently compare to the tutorial?
- added visual and audio features (sound effects, game fail effects etc.,)
- added level feature (increase tetromino falling speed based on score)
- added reset all button
- playable on mobile
- design (color, font choice, button etc.,)
- fixed multiple bugs (To name one, after paused game you can still force the brick to drop by press down arrow key. Fixed by adding condition into the arrow key)

## what have I learned building Tetris?

I feel more comfortable with using following concepts:

- document.addEventListener('action', function)
- document.querySelector('#yo') || document.getElementById('yo')
- fall = setInterval (drop , 1000) _drop is a function_ || clearInterval(fall)  
- Element.classList.remove('') || Element.classList.add('') || Element.classList.contains('')
- Element.style.backgroundColor = ('white') || Element.style.color = ('')
- Element.textContent || Element.innerHTML || Element.innerText
- array.forEach(function) || array.some(function) || array.every(function) _every is more often used for test condition purpose_
